Swerve contracts

## Development

```sh
docker-compose up
```

This will run the Docker containers attached to the console so the logs are actively visible and Ganache's blockchain updates can be seen in real-time. Alternatively, to run Docker Compose in detached mode:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
